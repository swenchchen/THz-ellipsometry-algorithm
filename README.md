# THz-ellipsometry-algorithm

This repository contains Matlab codes for processing THz ellipsometry data

The detail of the algorithm is available in the paper "Robust and Accurate Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopic Ellipsometry", by X. Chen et al.

The paper in under review, The detail information and the link will be updated later

For running the algorithm, please open the main function "Ellipsometry_algorithm.m"

The main function will call the other sub-functions included in this branch

Some important explanation has been described in the main function code

Three experimental data files, "cond_side_s.txt", "cond_side_p.txt" and "cond_side_pos16.txt" have also been included
