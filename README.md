# THz-ellipsometry-algorithm
This repository contains Matlab codes for processing THz ellipsometry data

The detail of the algorithm is available in the paper "Robust and Accurate Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopic Ellipsometry", by X. Chen et al.

The paper in under review and detail information and link will be updated later

Some important information has been included in the major processing code named "Ellipsometry_algorithm.m"
